        My research is focused on bioinformatics and computational biology, emphasizing high-throughput biological data analysis to integrate complex datasets and drive impactful discoveries. My expertise includes developing bioinformatics tools, performing advanced data analysis, and employing statistical modeling with applications in genomics, epigenomics, cancer genomics, immunology, and infectious diseases. As a Bioinformatics Liaison at the Center for Human Health and the Environment (CHHE), I collaborate with researchers across diverse disciplines, ensuring the effective integration of bioinformatics into a wide range of projects. My role involves contributing to bioinformatics initiatives, strategic research planning, and fostering collaborative efforts to address complex biological questions. Additionally, I guide and mentor PhD students, helping them navigate intricate bioinformatics challenges and develop essential research skills. I am committed to advancing scientific discovery and nurturing the next generation of researchers by creating cutting-edge tools and cultivating a dynamic, interdisciplinary research environment. My work aims to spark interest in the multidisciplinary nature of bioinformatics and its transformative potential for modern science.
